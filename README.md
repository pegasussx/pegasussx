With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I am a full-stack engineer passionate about creating robust, user-centered solutions that drive business growth. My experience spans building dynamic web applications, developing microservices, and optimizing cloud infrastructure for high performance and scalability. Skilled in modern JavaScript frameworks, cloud platforms, and data management, I lead projects from ideation to deployment, ensuring secure, efficient, and maintainable solutions.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me experimenting with new tech, brainstorming ideas for side projects, or just enjoying the outdoors. Iâ€™m always open to new connections and ideas â€“ letâ€™s build something amazing together!
